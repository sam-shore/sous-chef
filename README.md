## Etc.

This repo is deliberately vague in some areas and deficient in others as this isn't formal documentation presently, so be forewarned: you're on your own, Mount Doom, etc. But, if you stumbled here, and you're looking to open a restaurant, [check us out](http://www.touchbistro.com) for really reals.
