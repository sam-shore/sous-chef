# Menus To Go

Menus To Go is our private API for polling menu information for a particular venue.

## Architecture

TouchBistro is unique in the mobile point-of-sale space. We've taken what some of us have come to call it colloquially  a "cloud last" approach to our architecture, where we primarily build and focus on our client (iPad-based) apps being able to function entirely without the cloud. We upload data to the cloud when we can for reports and other features, but our core app doesn't rely on the internet. That's proven very appealing to our customer.
